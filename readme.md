# Replit Blog

Welcome to the source code for the Replit blog! 

## How to make a blog post

We have a handbook doc that runs you through how to make your blog post from drafting to publishing, check it out [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1np2uBRnmCkkJltCWll7oV-IuwkcJem2EMGoNQyKt040/edit#heading=h.49852hvllkdm).

### Run

If you're not inside a Repl, to run use Node: `node index.js`.

(don't forget to install dependencies with `npm install`)
